## Troubleshooting
* **The overlay won't open.**<br>
  Make sure you are using ngld's overlay and have everything setup as described <a href="https://github.com/FFXIV-ACT/setup-guide#readme">here</a>.

* **The overlay is too small / big.**<br>
  In your overlay plugin tab, select klondike, and then Advanced. You'll find a "Zoom" slider you can adjust to fit your preference.
  
* **My problem isn't listed here.**
  You can find the ACT FAQ <a href="https://gist.github.com/ngld/e2217563bbbe1750c0917217f136687d">here</a>. If you still have a problem, raise an issue or reach out on discord.
