* klondike is **not compatible** with the deprecated hibiyasleep nor RainbowMage Overlay Plugins. See an explanation 
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/ngld/e2217563bbbe1750c0917217f136687d#what-is-the-difference-between-the-ngld-overlayplugin-and-hibiyasleep-overlayplugin">here</a> on the differences and why to upgrade.

## How To Install

1. Ensure your ACT, FFXIV ACT Plugin, and Overlay Plugin are up-to-date.
2. Add a custom overlay as described <a href="https://github.com/FFXIV-ACT/setup-guide#custom-overlays">here</a> and use https://kalilistic.github.io/klondike as the URL.

## Troubleshooting
* **The overlay won't open.**<br>
  Make sure you are using the most recent version of ngld's overlay plugin.

* **The overlay window is too small / big.**<br>
  You can click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the window.
  
* **The overlay text is too small / big.**<br>
  In your overlay plugin tab, select klondike, and then Advanced. You'll find a "Zoom" slider you can adjust to fit your preference.
  
* **No overlays are working for me - not just klondike.**<br>
  Review the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ngld/e2217563bbbe1750c0917217f136687d">ACT FAQ</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FFXIV-ACT/setup-guide#readme">ACT Setup Guide</a>.
